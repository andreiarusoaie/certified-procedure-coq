This file contains the style guidelines which are used for the Coq code in this project.
These guidelines are meant to help maintaining the code on the long run and to offer a better
understanding of it.

1. Spacing & Alignment
  - No TABS; all indents should be 2 (two) spaces
  - Lines should not be longer than 99 characters
  - Only Linux line breaks

2. Capitalization
  - Coq definitions use the Pascal Case capitalization
  - Coq functions use the camel Case capitalization

3. Modular code
  - Code should be modular. This is not easy to quantify, but make sure that:
    + Each file should be focused on a single concept. Example: ProofSystem.v - contains the
      definition of the proof system and some other stuff related strictly to it
    + Use comments for documenting the code
    + Use indentation in proofs
